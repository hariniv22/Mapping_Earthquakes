# Mapping_Earthquakes

Main objective is to use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 
Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. 
In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

Along with earthquake map, we create two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, 
We could see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and also earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map
